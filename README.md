go-2-iTerm2
===========

### Setup

Make a shortcut on your finder to either the "tab" or the "window" app

### How it works

The app use the current focused finder and opens an iTerm2 window or tab

### Thanks

This script is heavily inspired by this repo :

### TOFIX

- When iTerm2 is open but has no term open, launching the application triggers an error
- Do a better icon !
